# Automated autofix tests

Automated autofix tests are integration tests designed to test the autofix functionality.

`test-automated-fix.sh` performs an autofix on the test cases and compares their output with the
expected one.

## Testing

Run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
./test-automated-fix.sh
```
